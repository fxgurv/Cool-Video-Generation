 Word Highlight Subtitles:

Each word is highlighted individually as it is spoken
Words appear in normal color (default: white) and get highlighted in an accent color (default: #4CAF50 green) when spoken
Words are positioned dynamically with proper line breaks
Example: "This is a" (white) "sample" (green) "text" (white)






Background Highlight Subtitles:

Similar to word highlighting but instead of changing text color, it adds a background color behind each word
Words appear with a transparent background initially
When a word is spoken, its background gets highlighted with the chosen color
Example: "This is a" (no background) "sample" (green background) "text" (no background)
Simple Line-Level Subtitles
Traditional subtitle style where full lines of text appear
Supports customization of:
Font family (Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, etc.)
Font size
Text color
Position on screen
Maximum characters per line (default: 80)
Maximum number of lines (default: 2)
Stroke/outline color and width
Key Features for All Subtitle Types:

Customizable styling through the UI
Draggable positioning on screen
Support for different video dimensions (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)
Automatic line breaking based on maximum characters
Synchronized with audio using timestamp data from Whisper transcription

The subtitles are implemented in the subtitle.py utility file and can be previewed/customized through the subtitle_editor.html interface before being applied to videos.

1. WORD HIGHLIGHT SUBTITLES ‚ú®
python
Copy code
Style Type: word_highlight
Default Configuration:
{
    "font": "Helvetica-Bold",
    "fontsize": 30,
    "color": "white",
    "highlight_color": "#4CAF50",
    "stroke_width": 1.5,
    "stroke_color": "black"
}
Technical Implementation:

Creates two TextClips for each word:
Base clip: Normal state (white)
Highlight clip: Active state (green)
Dynamic positioning system:
X_buffer = frame_width * 0.1
Y_buffer = frame_height * 0.2
Word spacing = fontsize * 0.3
Automatic line breaks when x_pos + word_width > frame_width
Vertical spacing = fontsize + 10px between lines
Animation Flow:

Words appear in default white color
Each word highlights in green during its spoken duration
Returns to white after word completion
Smooth transition effects between states
